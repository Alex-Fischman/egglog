;; Example for using the :unextractable rewrite argument to do one-way rewriting

;; Let's pretend that we are optimizing mathematical expressions, but for some reason on our compiler
;; multiplying by three is very expensive. So we want to rewrite those forms to three additions instead, and always
;; extract that form.

(datatype Math
  (Num i64)
  (Var String)
  (Add Math Math)
  (Mul Math Math))


(rewrite (Mul (Num 3) x) :unextractable (Add x (Add x x)))

(let x (Mul (Num 2) (Mul (Num 3) (Var "x"))))

(run 10)

; When X is extracted, we get the optimized form, where the * 3 is expanded out
(check (= x (Mul (Num 2) (Add (Var "x") (Add (Var "x") (Var "x"))))))
(extract x)
